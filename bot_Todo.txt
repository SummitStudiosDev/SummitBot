put badwords in diff file cus its long
and put the events in on cog
you can just use commands.Cog.listener() for everything


-disable automod (buggy add for automod update)
-for embeds in future update, add requested by ___
-custom help in embed update
-modlog in mod update

store cogs in diff py

villager bot used https://www.postgresql.org/ to store infividual prefixes (used asyncpg to connect to the database)
stores other stuff like list of cursed images or the keys for the bot in json


ctx.guild.default_role is @everyone

For Check Permissions, if you wnat to do if it has this perm OR it has this perm do this:
https://github.com/Villager-Dev/Villager-Bot/blob/7b9e302cda2c1261631b265f0a85483a4e788c65/cogs/commands/admin.py#L120

If instead you want to do if it has this perm AND it has this perm:
@commands.has_permissions(administrator=True, manage_messages=True, manage_roles=True)


to run code using console:
windows: py bot.py
linux: python3 bot.py
